531
===

Overview
---
Currently this is a simple python(**3**) script that calculates a training cycle using the popular 531 template


Usage
---
Invoke it by calling python main.py. It will ask you for your current reps for following exercises:
* Shoulder Press
* Deadlift
* Bench Press
* Squat

And using the numbers that you provided (in **kg**) and reps it calculates your 1RM and your training 1RM which is roughly 90% of your 1RM.
Calling the script creates a folder called cycle_1 (usually) and it will contain 4 csv files for each week.
